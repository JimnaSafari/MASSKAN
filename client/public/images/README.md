Public images
=============

Use this folder for static images you want to reference by URL.

How to use:
- Place files here, e.g. `hero.jpg` â†’ available at `/images/hero.jpg`.
- Reference in JSX/CSS without import:

  JSX: `<img src="/images/hero.jpg" alt="Hero" />`
  CSS: `background-image: url('/images/hero.jpg');`

Good for:
- Logos, large media, CMS-like content, or files not processed by Vite.
